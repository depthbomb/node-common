# node-common

A set of common utilities for Node.js that I use in my projects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of version 2.0.0, a majority of the utilities in this package have been extracted out into the new [@depthbomb/common](https://npmjs.com/package/@depthbomb/common) package. This package will continue to receive Node.js-only utilities.

Documentation and additional TSDocs coming soon.
